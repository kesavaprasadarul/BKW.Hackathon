## 🚀 User Flow

### 1. Home Page (`/`)
- Hero section with DraftingCompass icon
- Compelling headline and subtitle
- Drag & drop upload area for Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- "How it works" section with 3 steps
- **Auto-navigation**: Uploads trigger redirect to `/processing`

### 2. Processing Page (`/processing`)
- Progress stepper showing current step
- Animated loading state with Brain icon
- Progress percentage indicator
- **Auto-navigation**: Redirects to `/results/step1` after 3 seconds

### 3. Step 1 Results (`/results/step1`)
- Displays room type optimization results
- 3 metric cards showing:
  - Optimized rooms (47 of 52)
  - Improvement rate (90%)
  - Accuracy (98%)
- Detailed optimization breakdown
- Key changes highlighted
- **Manual navigation**: "Continue" button to `/results/step2-processing`

### 4. Step 2 Processing (`/results/step2-processing`)
- Progress stepper showing step 2 active, step 1 completed
- Loading state with Zap icon
- Progress bar animation
- **Auto-navigation**: Redirects to `/results/step2` after 3 seconds

### 5. Step 2 Results (`/results/step2`)
- Energy consumption forecast results
- 3 metric cards showing:
  - Optimized energy consumption (45 W/m²)
  - Heating power (57 kW)
  - Annual consumption (143,820 kWh)
- Energy distribution by room type (with progress bars)
- Optimization highlights grid
- **Manual navigation**: "Continue" button to `/report`

### 6. Final Report (`/report`)
- All 3 steps completed in progress stepper
- Export button in header
- 4 key metric cards (energy, cost, heating, CO₂)
- **Comparison section**: Side-by-side standard vs optimized scenarios
- **Cost chart**: Monthly projection chart with Recharts
- Savings summary card
- Detailed parameter change table
- Tabbed interface:
  - Overview: Project summary
  - Technical Details: Building & heating system specs
  - Recommendations: 4 actionable steps

## 🔧 Running the Project

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access at: http://localhost:3000

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🎨 Styling Notes

### Tailwind CSS v4
The project uses the new Tailwind CSS v4 with the `@theme inline` directive in `globals.css`. Custom colors are defined as CSS variables and mapped to Tailwind classes.

### Custom Classes Available
- `bg-primary-blue` / `text-primary-blue`
- `bg-success-green` / `text-success-green`
- `bg-warning-amber` / `text-warning-amber`
- `bg-text-primary` / `text-text-primary`
- `bg-text-secondary` / `text-text-secondary`
- And more...

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 768px (stacked layouts)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (2-column layouts)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (multi-column layouts)

### Adaptive Features
- Navigation stays fixed on all screens
- Progress stepper adjusts for mobile
- Charts are fully responsive
- Upload area scales appropriately
- Metric cards stack on mobile

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] Backend API integration
- [ ] Real file upload processing
- [ ] PDF export functionality
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Multi-language (German/English toggle)
- [ ] Historical analysis comparison
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Project save/load functionality

## 📝 Notes

### Current Implementation
- All pages are client-side rendered (`'use client'`)
- Navigation uses Next.js App Router
- File upload is validated but not processed (mock data)
- Auto-navigation uses timeouts for demo purposes
- All data is hardcoded for demonstration

### Design Adherence
The implementation strictly follows the CLAUDE.md specification:
- ✅ Minimalist design with no box-on-box
- ✅ Elegant blue color palette
- ✅ Clean white backgrounds with subtle shadows
- ✅ Generous white space
- ✅ Inter font family
- ✅ Lucide React icons exclusively
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

## 🎉 Completion

All core features and pages have been successfully implemented. The application is fully functional and ready for demo purposes. The next steps would involve:
1. Backend API integration
2. Real data processing
3. PDF export implementation
4. Production deployment

The UI is production-ready and follows modern React/Next.js best practices with TypeScript for type safety.
